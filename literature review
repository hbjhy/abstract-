It would appear that accurately measuring and projecting market losses is of the utmost
importance in both developed and emerging financial markets. The increasing interest shown
by foreign financial investors in investing in emerging financial markets highlights the
significance of accurately quantifying and predicting market risk. Zikovic & Aktan (2009) .
Lower liquidity, frequent internal and external shocks, and a higher degree of insider trading are
the fundamental characteristics of emerging markets, all of which contribute to the market's
increased volatility. Miletic (2013).
Emerging markets are distinguished from developed countries by a greater influence of internal
trade, as well as by high volatility, illiquidity, and market shallowness. These characteristics
combine to make the assessment of VaR using typical techniques that assume a normal
distribution substantially more difficult, and they are only a few of the numerous studies that
deal with the proper estimate and forecasting. Alexander and Leigh (1997). Despite this, there
is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all model for risk mapping. Within the United States Federal
Crop Insurance Program context, investigated VaR and dependence models. Ramsey and
Goodwin (2019)
Due to the fact that the program encompasses policies for such a diverse assortment of crops,
plans, and locations, this matter is quite complicated. The outcomes are influenced by the
weather as well as other latent variables such as pests. Because of this, the dependency structure
is quite complicated and a standard reinsurance agreement (SRA) makes it possible for a portion
of the risk to be transferred to the federal government, the calculation of value at risk (VaR) is
extremely important. Christoffersen, Hahn, and Inoue (2001), It is common practice to express
VaR in terms of a probable maximum loss, also known as PML, or as a return in the form of a
loss over a specified time period. The body of work on VaR models in emerging financial
markets, as well as the empirical research into these models, is not nearly as extensive as the
body of work that addresses the calculation of VaR in developed financial markets some
examples of this type of work include.De Melo Mendes (2003).
This is in contrast to the body of work that addresses the calculation of VaR in developed
financial markets. Using, but not limited to, historical time series data did not make it possible
to carry out an econometric analysis that could be relied upon. States that this is due to the
elliptical shape of the data. (the stock markets of the vast majority of these countries didn't even
come into existence until the early 1990s) .Zikovic and Aktan (2009) To determine whether
there was or wasn't Connection between the start of the global financial crisis and the relativeperformance of VaR models of the returns of indices on the Turkish and Croatian stock
exchanges. Through the use of this study, they were able to show that theoretical frameworks
such as extreme value theory and The models that are the most accurate are hybrid historical
simulations, whereas other models grossly underestimate the level of risk. Djakovic and Radisic
(2009).
The research conducted an analysis of the stock markets of four developing nations
Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Hungary; primary takeaways from their research indicated
that, given stable market conditions, the analyzed stock markets had the potential to
outperform the developed nations' stock markets, while the market volatility was being
analyzed, the models which included parametric and historical simulation models provided
accurate forecasts of VaR estimations with a confidence level of 95%. Cheng, and Wong
(2002), Andjelic (2010). Estimates of VaR parameters can be obtained from models, and the
level of confidence in these estimates is typically at least 99% of the time method, in addition
to Forecasting the value at risk of an index on a stock exchange in the Serbian financial
market using the GARCH and integrated GARCH (IGARCH) models.
Mladenovic, Andjelic and Radisic (2010) .
An investigation was conducted into the efficacy of the RiskMetrics method, and They
arrived at the conclusion that GARCH models, when used in conjunction with the theory of
extreme values (the peaks-over-threshold method), decrease the overall mean value of the
value at risk, and that these models are superior to the RiskMetrics method, which is used
in conjunction with the IGARCH model. Miletic and Miletic (2012)
Despite the fact that the phrase "Value at Risk" did not become common parlance until the
middle of the 1990s, the measurement's roots go far further back in time. The mathematical
foundations of VaR were principally conceived of and developed within the framework of
portfolio theory . Harry Markowitz (1990). Despite the fact that they were working towards
a distinct goal, which was the development of optimum investment portfolios for equity
investors. VaR is calculated with a primary emphasis on market risks and the consequences
of the comovements in these risks. In particular, the focus on market risks is key to the
process. Karen K. Lewis (1999)
However, the crises that have befallen financial service corporations over the course of time
and the regulatory reactions to these crises served as the motivation for the application of VaRmeasures in these organizations. Following the Great Depression and the many bank failures
that took place during this era, there was a period of economic instability. Aswath Damodaran
(2007), the Securities Exchange Act was passed. Zikovic and Aktan (2008) This act
established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and mandated that banks keep
their borrowings at a level that was less than 2,000 per cent of their equity capital. This marked
the start of the regulatory capital requirements that banks have to comply with. In the decades
that followed, financial institutions developed various risk mitigation strategies and
management mechanisms in order to guarantee that they would satisfy these capital needs.
Randall Guynn, Davis Polk (2010)
The Uniform Net Capital Rule (UNCR), which was enacted by the SEC in 1975, was
responsible for the refinement and expansion of capital requirements. In accordance with this
rule, the financial assets that banks held were divided into twelve distinct depending on the
degree of risk connected with each, and the banks were required to maintain varying levels of
capital for each class, ranging from 0% for short-term treasuries to 30% for
equities.https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-82951
The heightened risk that was produced in the early 1970s due to the emergence of derivative
markets and floating-rate currency rates led to the rise of capital needs in many different
industries. Aswath Damodaran (2007). This was done in response to In quarterly statements
that were termed " In its "Financial and Operating Combined Uniform Single" (FOCUS)
reports, financial institutions were required to report on the calculations that went into their
capital reserves‚Äù. Roberto Bustreo (2013)
In 1980, the SEC instituted the first regulatory measures that evoke Value at Risk by tying
comparing the capital needs of financial service companies to the damages that might result
from a 95% confidence level over a 30-day interval in various security classes; these potential
losses were computed using historical returns. Aswath Damodaron (2007) Value at Risk is a
risk management framework that was developed by J. Markowitz and first introduced in the
1970s. The SEC clearly intended for financial services businesses to start the process of
assessing one-month 95% Value at Risks and keep sufficient capital to cover the probable
losses, despite the fact that the metrics were labeled as haircuts rather than Value or Capital at
Risk. Aswath Damodaran (2007) This was the case despite the fact that in place of Value or
Capital at Risk, metrics were referred to as haircuts. VALUE AT RISK (VAR) - New York
University. https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/VAR.pdfAround the same time, the trading portfolios of investment and commercial banks were
getting bigger and more volatile, which resulted in the need for risk management
techniques that were both more complex and more timely. In 1986, Ken Garbade at
Banker's Trust developed sophisticated metrics of Value at Exposure of the company's
fixed-income holdings to danger. Bond interest rates of varying maturities were used to
derive these measures. All save the most senior workers of Banker's Trust had access to
these internal documents. https://documentsn.com/document/c5b0_value-at-risk-var.html
By the early 1990s, a large number of companies that provide financial services had created
basic measurements of Value at Risk, with a large variety of approaches to its measurement
used. Ken Garbade (1990)
After a series of disastrous losses associated with the use of derivatives and influence
around 1993 and 1995, firms were ready for more comprehensive risk measures. This was
made possible by the failure of Barings, the British investment bank, due to the unlicensed
dealing in Nikkei futures and options by Singaporean trader NickLeeson.
https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/VAR.The collapse of Barings was
the climax of these losses, and it signalled that businesses were ready to implement broader
risk controls. J.P. Morgan (1995) The data on the variances of and covariances across
various security and asset classes, which J.P. Morgan had been using internally for almost
a decade to manage risk, were made available to the public. J.P Morgan (1995). This
enabled software manufacturers to develop software that could measure risk. The company
decided to call the service "Risk Metrics," and it described the risk measure that was
derived from the data using the phrase "Value at Risk." The commercial and investment
banks as well as the regulatory bodies that oversaw them, quickly warmed up to the
proposal because of its intuitive appeal, which found a ready audience with them the
previous 10 years have seen a number of changes, value at risk (VaR) has emerged as the
preeminent method for determining the level of risk exposure in financial service
corporations and has even started to gain popularity in other types of businesses. J.P.
Morgan (1995)
The approach that is taken by extreme value theory is marginally superior to that which is taken
by the GARCH model was the conclusion that was reached. Mladenovic et al. (2012). This
research was based on the authors' findings. In addition to the nations located in Eastern Europe
(Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, and Romania). And Serbia), but in general,
they recommend utilizing both strategies for improved market risk management. This is due to
the fact that markets are becoming increasingly volatile. Measurement. Bucevska (2012)Some evidence that the most accurate models of the GARCH family make use of the following
formula: Estimating the level of volatility that exists on the Macedonian stock market using
the asymmetric exponential moving average is the model that has proven to be the most
accurate. Julija, Milena & Sa≈°a (2017) GARCH (EGARCH) model with Student's tdistribution, the EGARCH model with normal, GARCH (EGARCH) model with GARCH
(EGARCH) model with, distribution in addition to the GARCH-GJR model that was developed
by Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle. GARCH (EGARCH) model with normal distribution.
This study's conclusions have substantial implications for the Methodology that should be used
to estimate VaR in volatile environments. Julija, Milena & Sa≈°a (2017) The findings also shed
light on the conditions that investors in emerging capital markets will need to address in order
to be successful. In addition to Miletic, Miletic was also responsible for the implementation of
the GARCH models (2015). The study's objective has been to develop estimate methods that
are more accurate and provide more trustworthy values for variance and covariance, which can
then be used in VaR calculations. Some people have proposed making improvements to
sampling techniques and developing new data innovations, both of which would make it
possible to get more accurate estimates of variances and covariances going ahead. Some people
believe that improvements in statistical methods may provide more accurate estimates from
the same data. Specifically, the standard deviation of returns is assumed not to fluctuate over
time in order to calculate VaR using traditional methods (homoskedasticity). When the
standard deviation is allowed to fluctuate over time, Engle contends, we receive considerably
more accurate predictions. This is due to the fact that these models include time-varying
standard deviations (heteroskedasticity). Engle, R., (2001), Aswath Damodaran ( 2007)
In fact, he suggests two variants‚ÄîAutoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)‚Äîthat provide more
accurate variance predictions and, thus, more reliable valuations of risk. These forms of
heteroskedasticity are called as Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
and Generalized ARCH (GARCH), respectively. However, the variance-covariance VaRestimate was designed for portfolios in which the relationship between risk and portfolio
positions is linear, which is another criticism that may be levelled against it. Aswath
Damodaran(2007) This is a criticism that may be thrown against the variance-covariance
estimate of VaR. Since of this, it is possible for it to fail when the portfolio contains options
because the payoffs on options do not follow a linear pattern. Researchers have created
quadratic Value at-risk metrics to manage the implications of options and other non-linear
instruments that might be used in portfolios. Britten-Jones, M. and Schaefer, S.M (1999)
Researchers are now able to estimate the Value at Risk for complex portfolios that
incorporate options and option-like instruments such as convertible bonds. This contrasts
with the more conventional linear models, which are known as delta-normal models. The
price to pay, however, is that the mathematics involved in determining the VaR will
become far more sophisticated, and a portion of the intuitive understanding will be lost
along the way. Julija, Milena & Sa≈°a (2017) The conditional standard deviation used herein
serves as the first theoretical model of volatility, and it was proposed by Engle (1982) as a
solution to the problem of the volatility of inflation rate time series. The Autoregressive
Conditionally Heteroskedastic (ARCH) model is an example of this type of model. The
Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (GARCH) model was
introduced by Bollerslev (1986) primarily for financial data. This model is particularly
well-suited for the investigation and prediction of volatility. Nelson's (1991)
Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model enables both positive and negative returns on
assets to have an asymmetric influence on the model's output of volatility. Another
volatility model that takes into account leverage is called the Threshold-GARCH (TGARCH) model, which was developed by Zakoian (1994). The univariate GARCH model
is converted into the multivariate GARCH model so that the portfolio of assets may be
analyzed. The Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC-) GARCH model was initially
suggested by Bollerslev (1990). Engle and Sheppard (2001) enhanced the CCC-GARCH
model by configuring the correlation matrix to vary over time. As a result, the Dynamic
Conditional Correlation (DCC-) GARCH model was established. Julija, Milena & Sa≈°a
(2017)In recent years, some accomplishments have been accomplished using the ARMA model,
ARCH model, and\SGARCH model in the research of volatility in the Chinese mainland stock
market. Wang, Yu, and Zhou (2014) conducted an empirical investigation of the link that exists
between the Shanghai Composite Index's return rate and the threat it presents. https://en.frontsci.com/index.php/memf/article/view/327/431
According to the findings, there is a satisfactory fitting effect, which illustrates the connection
that exists between the rate of return and the level of risk. This helps me not only study\she the
return rate but also have volatility to gauge the danger while researching the Chinese
mainland\sstock market. Lu (2006) Developed a non-parametric GARCH model to forecast
the volatility of the Chinese stock market better. Both the ARIMA and ARCH models were
employed by him (2008) to forecast stock prices, and the findings demonstrate that the ARCH
model is more satisfying. For this reason, I combine the GARCH model with the ARMA
model.
The exchange rate risk and interest rate risk were both integrated into the capital market-based
asset-pricing model that Solnik (1972) developed. After conducting research on the stock
markets of seven different countries, the researchers came to the conclusion that although
domestic factors are still the most significant contributors to a country's capital price, factors
from other countries do have some impact on the capital price of a country. On the basis of
this, King and Wadhwani (1990) applied the model to the markets of many different countries,
thereby providing further proof that the stock price of a country is influenced not only by the
information of its own public information but also by the stock price information of other
countries. Karolyi (1996) discovered that there is a transmission in both directions between the
stock markets of the United States and Japan. According to the findings of Hu and Xu (2003),
the volatility of the Hong Kong stock market is more strongly correlated with that of the
Shanghai composite index than that of the United States stock market. Additionally, they
learned that the Shanghai Composite Index's and the S&P Index's regression coefficients'
degree of fitting is very low. Dongya Zhou (2020)
This finding indicates that the connection between the United States and the Chinese mainland
is still extremely poor. After the Asian financial crisis, Chen, Wu, and Liu (2006) observed
that the interconnectedness of stock markets in 11 nations and regions in the Asia-Pacific area
has greatly improved. This was the conclusion reached by the researchers.
Although there may have been a short-term guiding relationship between the U.S. stock
market and the Chinese mainland stock market, there is no stable cointegration relationshipbetween the Chinese mainland stock market and any other stock markets. The Chinese
mainland stock market has a weak exogenous. Zhang (2005)
further shown via the use of the E-GARCH model that there is no long-term cointegration
link between the international stock market and the stock market on the Chinese mainland.
However, the Hong Kong, London, and New York stock markets had one-way short-term
spillovers on the stock market of the Chinese mainland mostly before the financial crisis
that occurred in 1997. Zhang (2005)CHAP 2 METHODOLOGY
