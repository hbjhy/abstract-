Our purpose is to estimate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio consisting of four
financial instruments based on two GARCH-family models. We first created a portfolio
and checked the basic properties of a time series of this portfolio. Then we focused on
finding the best model from the GARCH family. Finally, we estimated the VaR of the
portfolio. Our portfolio is composed of 3 financial instruments and 1 cryptocurrency
S&P 500, DAX, WAG20, and BIT our consideration period of 13 years, just after the
2008 world financial crisis, which means that our sample period starts from 01/01/ 2009
to 31/05/2022, which is the last day I started the research
4.1 PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS
We started by downloading a dataset of daily observations of SP&500, DAX, WIG20 and
BTC. The chosen period was 2009/01/01 â€“ 2022/05/31. We built a portfolio consisting of
the above four instruments. We also calculated the log returns of every instrument as well
as the returns for an equally weighted portfolio (EWP). Table 2 Alpha1 is negative and
significant, so the asymmetry is found According to the weighted Ljung-box test, the
initial lags are NOT serially correlated P-values on the weighted ljung-box test on
squared residuals are fairly high, and first, lags are significant, indicating we need not add
anything to the covariance equation. P-values on the weighted ARCH LM test are fairly
high, indicating we need not add anything to the variance equation.
The test results are higher than the crucial value. Therefore the null is rejected for all the
parameters except gamma1. The Nyblom stability test verifies that each parameter
separately is stable over time (no structural breaks in the model). We also accept the
stability jointly (1.9723 < 2.11). The model as a whole is stable over time The Sign Bias
Test verifies that the asymmetry has been captured correctly in the estimated model. The
model does not require higher order. The statistics are higher than the significance level.
